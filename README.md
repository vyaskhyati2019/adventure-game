Python Adventure Game: The Hidden Treasure Quest
Simplilearn Course-end Project 2
This project is a text-based adventure game built using Python and GitHub Copilot. The game focuses on fundamental programming concepts like functions, conditionals, and user input validation, providing an interactive CLI experience for the player.

🎮 Game Overview
The player takes on the role of an explorer in an ancient land. By navigating through a dense forest or a mysterious cave, the player must collect clues and solve riddles to reach the final chamber and claim the legendary treasure.

🛠️ Key Features
Dynamic Branching Logic: Multiple paths (Forest, Cave, Ruins) with different outcomes based on player choices.

AI-Assisted Development: Developed using GitHub Copilot to optimize code efficiency and structure.

Input Validation: A robust helper function handles user inputs to prevent crashes and ensure case-insensitivity.

Success Tracking: A hidden point system tracks whether the player has gathered enough clues (map fragments) to unlock the final treasure chest.
